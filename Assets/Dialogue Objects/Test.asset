  - 'Hello Lost Time-Keeper.


    My name is Gobi, I welcome thee to my beloved
    post!'
  - Currently this is just a demo, and you're at the tutorial for this game.
  - I'm not here to explain your story, that's for you to learn throughout the later
    game.
  - But you must be wondering why I'm here?
  - Well, this is where I'm gonna teach you the basics!
  - "For starters, you already know how to move around using WSAD. \n\nPressing space
    will let ya jump."
  - "By pressing Q, you'll draw/sheathe your weapon. \n\nClick for combat."
  - 'Now that you''ve learned all of this...


    would you like to face off a Goblin
    Bandit to test the combat?'
